			<h3>What a message rule is</h3>

			<p>eDesk message rules trigger automatic actions that are applied to a ticket based on unique characteristics that you choose.</p>

			<H3>How you can use message rules on edesk</H3>

			<p>Some customers use message rules to automatically <a href = "">apply tags to messages</a> or assign tickets to agents based on a variety of conditions, such as what marketplace the ticket comes from or what the associated product, customer or order value is. Others use it to assign incoming tickets evenly between customer service members in a round robin format. The options are many, and rules can be personalized to suit your business. </p>

			<H3><strong>Example</strong>: Use Message Rules to tag tickets based on marketplace </H3>
			<p>Automatically tagging messages as they come into your mailbox is a great way to keep your workflow organised. In this example I’m going to automatically tag all messages that come through Amazon, so that I can then find all they can find all my Amazon tickets in one place. I also have one agent who deals with all my Amazon queries, so I’ve also chosen, as part of this rule, to automatically assign them to that person.</p> 
			<p>To use this message rule, you’ll need to have already <a href = "">apply tags</a> set up tags on edesk.</p>

			<img src="https://dy639ytn88nua.cloudfront.net/support/education/rule_tagging.gif" width="640"></a>

			<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Name the rule and activate rule</p>
			<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Stipulate conditions</p>
			<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Create actions</p>
			<p><strong>Optional Step:</strong> Assigned all tickets meeting criteria to a particular support agent</p>
			<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Press create</p>
